The assignment provides a comprehensive exploration into one of the most notorious vulnerabilities in programming: buffer overflow, specifically within the context of C programming.

At the outset, students are presented with a seemingly innocuous C program. Its primary function is to authenticate users based on a password input. However, as students delve deeper, they uncover a lurking vulnerability. The program uses a fixed-size buffer to store the password, and there's no mechanism in place to check the length of the user's input against the buffer's size. This is a classic setup for a buffer overflow, where excessive input data can spill over the buffer's boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

The first task requires students to visually map out the program's memory layout by drawing the stack frame for the authentication function. This exercise is crucial as it provides a visual representation of how data, including the password buffer and authentication flag, is stored in memory.

With this understanding, students then move to the practical aspect. They compile the program with specific flags that strip away any built-in protections against buffer overflows. This naked version of the program is then subjected to a series of tests. The objective is clear: determine the precise length of input required to not just fill the buffer, but to overflow it to the point where the adjacent authentication flag is overwritten, thereby granting unauthorized access.

But the assignment doesn't stop at mere exploitation. It delves deeper into the 'why' and 'how'. Using a debugger, students are tasked with inspecting the program's memory in real-time. They set breakpoints, view memory addresses, and examine variable contents before and after the overflow. This hands-on approach demystifies the abstract concept of buffer overflows, making it tangible and understandable.

In conclusion, the assignment is more than just a coding exercise. It's a deep dive into the world of cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of meticulous coding practices, the dangers of overlooking seemingly minor details, and the profound implications such oversights can have in real-world applications.
